## Assignment 4 - Text classification

The two scripts do the following:

-->The first script should perform benchmark classification using standard machine learning approaches

This means CountVectorizer() or TfidfVectorizer(), LogisticRegression classifier

Save the results from the classification report to a text file

-->The second script should perform classification using the kind of deep learning methods we saw in class

Keras Embedding layer, Convolutional Neural Network

Save the classification report to a text file

## Structure

This repository has the following directory structure:

| Column | Description|
|--------|:-----------|
```data```| a folder to be used for inputting the data you wish to run
```notebooks``` | Jupyter notebooks in both .ipynb and .html format
```src``` | the .py script version of the assignments. The first script is assign_4.1, the second script is assign_4.py
```output``` | the results of inputting the toxic dataset. The first script's output is benchmark_assign_4.txt, the second script is deep_learning_assign_4.txt
