## Assignment 4 - Text classification

The two scripts do the following:

-->The first script should perform benchmark classification using standard machine learning approaches

This means CountVectorizer() or TfidfVectorizer(), LogisticRegression classifier

Save the results from the classification report to a text file

-->The second script should perform classification using the kind of deep learning methods we saw in class

Keras Embedding layer, Convolutional Neural Network

Save the classification report to a text file
